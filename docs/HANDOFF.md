## 🚀 Active Sprint: Sprint 5 (Admin Controls & Global Polish)

**Date/Time:** 2026-07-10 (Local Time)
**Agent:** Freebuff (Buffy)
**Ticket:** FFH-110

### What Changed

- **Backend (`handleDisconnect`):** After marking the player as disconnected in Redis, immediately broadcasts `RoomStateUpdated` to the room so all remaining clients see `isConnected: false` without waiting for the 30s cleanup timer. Added null guard for `this.server` in the fire-and-forget promise.
- **Backend (`buildRoomStatePayload`):** Added defensive null/undefined guard for `playersMap` to prevent `Object.values()` from throwing when Redis returns no data.
- **Frontend (PlayerList):** Disconnected player cards now render with `opacity-50 grayscale` for a pronounced offline visual state. (The avatar `opacity-60` was removed on review to avoid CSS opacity stacking making text illegible at 30%.)
- **Frontend (IN_PROGRESS sidebar):** Disconnected players in the gameplay sidebar now show `opacity-60 grayscale`, amber connection dot, and an `Offline` badge — consistent with the PlayerList component.
- **Verified:** `pnpm typecheck` ✅, `pnpm lint` ✅, `pnpm test` — 431/431 tests ✅

### Why

To satisfy all acceptance criteria for FFH-110, giving hosts and players immediate real-time visual feedback when a participant disconnects, with the offline indicator seamlessly clearing on reconnection.

### What's Next

Continue Sprint 5 — next ticket: FFH-111 (Duplicate Name Resolution), FFH-112 (Landing Page Overhaul), or FFH-113 (Global UI Consistency Audit).

**Date/Time:** 2026-07-09 (Local Time)
**Agent:** Freebuff (Buffy)
**Ticket:** FFH-108

### What Changed

- **canvas-confetti installed & integrated:** `useConfettiOnCorrectAnswer` hook fires confetti from both sides when `game.correctAnswer` transitions from null → value. Uses indigo/purple/pink/gold color palette.
- **Sound engine (`lib/sound/sound-engine.ts`):** Web Audio API-based with two tones — ascending chime for correct answers (C5→E5), short square-wave beep for timer warnings (final 5 seconds).
- **Mute persistence (`lib/sound/use-sound-settings.ts`):** React hook with localStorage persistence for global mute state.
- **SoundToggle component (`components/sound-toggle.tsx`):** Controlled button with speaker/mute SVG icons. Placed in all three lobby headers (FINISHED, IN_PROGRESS, lobby default).
- **Lobby page integration:** Three `useEffect` hooks — one for correct answer sound, one for timer warning ticks, and the confetti hook. Both sound effects respect `isMuted`.
- **Controlled component pattern:** `SoundToggle` receives `isMuted` + `onToggle` props from the single `useSoundSettings()` instance owned by the lobby page, preventing stale-state bugs.
- **Test mocks:** Added mocks for `canvas-confetti`, `sound-engine`, `use-sound-settings`, and `use-confetti` in the lobby page test.
- **Verified:** `pnpm typecheck` ✅, `pnpm lint` ✅, `pnpm test` — 142/142 tests ✅

### What Changed (Files)

- `apps/web/lib/sound/sound-engine.ts` — New: Web Audio API sound engine
- `apps/web/lib/sound/use-sound-settings.ts` — New: Mute state with localStorage
- `apps/web/lib/confetti/use-confetti.ts` — New: Confetti on correct answer
- `apps/web/components/sound-toggle.tsx` — New: Controlled mute toggle button
- `apps/web/app/lobby/[roomCode]/page.tsx` — Integrated confetti, sounds, SoundToggle
- `apps/web/app/lobby/[roomCode]/page.spec.tsx` — Added mocks for new modules
- `apps/web/package.json` — Added `canvas-confetti` dependency

### Why

To satisfy all acceptance criteria for FFH-108, adding micro-animations (confetti) and a sound engine with persistent mute toggle.

### What's Next

Sprint 4 is complete. Next logical step: Sprint 5 planning — consider production deployment, additional game types, or shared validation package.

**Date/Time:** 2026-07-09 (Local Time)
**Agent:** Freebuff (Buffy)
**Ticket:** FFH-107

### What Changed

- **Compact sidebar grid layout:** Lobby page restructured from a single centered card to a side-by-side split grid (room info panel on the left, player list on the right) with a fixed bottom action bar.
- **Reduced padding across all lobby components:** RoomInformationPanel (p-6→p-3, smaller fonts), PlayerList (cards p-4→p-2, smaller avatars h-11→h-7), LobbyControls (converted from vertical cards to horizontal inline bar).
- **Fixed bottom bar for host controls:** LobbyControls (player stats, status, Start Game) + Leave Room button moved to a sticky bottom bar, ensuring zero-scroll view above the fold.
- **Header made compact:** Logo (h-10→h-8), button sizes reduced, spacing tightened.
- **Lobby removed large hero icon + heading** to save vertical space.
- **Removed unused `useGameStore` user selector** from RoomInformationPanel (state.user was never set by the store).
- **Verified:** `pnpm typecheck` ✅, `pnpm lint` ✅, `pnpm test` — 142/142 tests ✅

### What Changed (Files)

- `apps/web/app/lobby/[roomCode]/page.tsx` — Side-by-side grid + fixed bottom bar layout
- `apps/web/components/room-information-panel.tsx` — Compact padding/fonts
- `apps/web/components/player-list.tsx` — Compact cards, single-column list
- `apps/web/components/lobby-controls.tsx` — Horizontal inline bar layout
- `apps/web/components/lobby-controls.spec.tsx` — Updated status message assertions
- `apps/web/components/room-information-panel.spec.tsx` — Updated text assertions
- `apps/web/components/player-list.spec.tsx` — Updated player count assertions

### Why

To satisfy all acceptance criteria for FFH-107, overhauling the lobby into a compact, high-density dashboard grid viewable above the fold.

### What's Next

Start `FFH-108: Micro-Animations & Sound Engine`.

**Date/Time:** 2026-07-09 (Local Time)
**Agent:** Freebuff (Buffy)
**Ticket:** FFH-106

### What Changed

- **Shareable Invite Link:** Added a prominent "Share Invite" button in the lobby header that copies the full invite URL (`/room/join?code=ROOMCODE`) to clipboard with a 2-second "Copied!" green confirmation state.
- **Auto-Filled Room Code:** On the Join page, when the room code is pre-filled from invite link search params (`?code=XYZ`), the Room Code input field is now locked (`disabled` + `readOnly`) with an "Auto-filled from invite link" indicator, so guests only need to enter their display name.
- **Clipboard UX:** `handleCopyInviteLink` uses `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` with `.catch()` fallback. Button transitions between "Share Invite" (share icon) and "Copied!" (checkmark icon, green styling) states.
- **Added test:** Verifies room code input is disabled, readonly, and shows the auto-filled indicator when opened via invite link.
- **Verified:** `pnpm typecheck` ✅, `pnpm lint` ✅, `pnpm test` — 142/142 tests ✅

### What Changed (Files)

- `apps/web/app/lobby/[roomCode]/page.tsx` — Added `copied` state, `handleCopyInviteLink`, and "Share Invite" button
- `apps/web/app/room/join/page.tsx` — Added `isCodeFromInvite` state, disabled input when pre-filled
- `apps/web/app/room/join/page.spec.tsx` — Added test for locked input on invite link

### Why

To satisfy all acceptance criteria for FFH-106, enabling hosts to share instant invite links that auto-fill the room code for guests.

### What's Next

Start `FFH-107: Compact Lobby Layout Redesign` (Epic 26 — NextUI-Style UI/UX Compact Revamp).
